### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Pierre Zemb and I am a **Tech Lead** at **[OVHcloud](https://www.ovhcloud.com)**. I love working with **distributed systems**, specifically around **data storage**.

I enjoy being part of open-source communities, through **[talks](https://pierrezemb.fr/talks)**, **[blogposts](https://pierrezemb.fr/posts)**, and contributions to:

* SenX
    * [Warp10](https://github.com/senx/warp10-platform/commits?author=PierreZ),
* Apache
    * [HBase](https://github.com/apache/hbase/commits/master?author=PierreZ),
    * [Flink](https://github.com/apache/flink/commits/master?author=PierreZ),
    * [Pulsar](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/commits/master?author=PierreZ) and some related plugins like [streamnative/kop (Kafka On Pulsar)](https://github.com/streamnative/kop/commits/master?author=PierreZ),
* Apple
    * [FoundationDB](https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/commits/master?author=PierreZ) and their [Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-kubernetes-operator/commits/master?author=PierreZ),
* and [others](https://github.com/PierreZ/).

I am also maintaining/playing with some projects such as:

* [awesome-cs-papers-and-implementations](https://github.com/PierreZ/awesome-cs-papers-and-implementations), An awesome list about the most iconic CS papers
* [fdb-etcd](https://github.com/PierreZ/fdb-etcd), An experiment to provide ETCD layer on top of Record-Layer and FoundationDB.

On my free time, I am giving a hand to local events, such as the local GDG/JUG **[FinistDevs](https://finistdevs.org/)**, **[Devoxx4Kids](https://twitter.com/devoxx4kidsbes)** and **[DevFest du Bout du Monde](https://devfest.duboutdumonde.bzh/)**, a technical conference. I am also a **teaching assistant** in my former Engineer School.

I cofounded in 2017 **[HelloExoWorld](https://helloexo.world/)**, a initiative to search for exoplanets using Warp10, a time-series platform.
