### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Pierre Zemb and Iâ€™m a senior Software Engineer building data infrastructure at Clever Cloud. I've built and operated a variety of stateful distributed systems throughout my career.

Iâ€™m interested in distributed systems, data stores, understanding how things works under the hood. I enjoy being part of open-source communities, through [talks](/talks), [posts](/posts), and [contributions](https://github.com/PierreZ/) to:

* SenX [Warp10](https://github.com/senx/warp10-platform/commits?author=PierreZ),
* Apache [HBase](https://github.com/apache/hbase/commits/master?author=PierreZ), [Flink](https://github.com/apache/flink/commits/master?author=PierreZ), [Pulsar](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/commits/master?author=PierreZ),
* PingCAP [go-ycsb](https://github.com/pingcap/go-ycsb/commits/master?author=PierreZ),
* Apple [FoundationDB](https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/commits/master?author=PierreZ) and their [Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-kubernetes-operator/commits/master?author=PierreZ),
* StreamNative [KoP (Kafka On Pulsar)](https://github.com/streamnative/kop/commits/master?author=PierreZ), Kafka protocol handler for Pulsar,
* CNCF [ETCD](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/commits/master?author=PierreZ),

I am also maintaining some projects such as:

* [PierreZ/goStatic](https://github.com/PierreZ/goStatic), A really small static web server for Docker,
* [PierreZ/fdb-etcd](https://github.com/PierreZ/fdb-etcd), An experiment to provide ETCD layer on top of Record-Layer and FoundationDB,
* [PierreZ/Record-Store](https://pierrez.github.io/record-store/), A light, multi-model, user-defined place for your data.
